- **React.js:** JavaScript library on the client side for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** Server-side runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Vite:** Build tool for the frontend, providing fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Jest:** Testing framework for JavaScript projects.
